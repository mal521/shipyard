# Shipyard: Business OS

> A seminar business by Megan & Caleb, helping high school students build real AI projects for their portfolios.

## Core Thesis
AI changed how things get built. High school students are the best-positioned people to learn this skill because they're starting fresh with no habits to unlearn. Shipyard teaches them to direct AI to build real, working projects in 90 minutes. The comparison is against coding bootcamps ($15K, 3 months), not college. This skill complements any path a student chooses.
